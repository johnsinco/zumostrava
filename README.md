ZUMOSTRAVA
----------

A simple AngularJS / NodeJS based app to read segment data from [Strava](http://strava.com) and flag 'suspicious' segment leader activities based on a simple statistical analysis. 

TO DO 
------
1. Still need to add geo lookup based on zipcode for segments
2. Enhance display based on deviation of the times
